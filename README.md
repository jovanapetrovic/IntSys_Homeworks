<h3>Local search algorithm</h3>
<h3>Travelling Salesman Problem & Hill Climbing algorithm</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
<p>
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous algorithm problems. 
It asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between 
 each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once?"
</p>
<h4>Solution/algorithm description</h4>
<p>
Hill Climbing algorithm is variation of a generate-and-test algorithm which discards 
all states which do not look promising or seem unlikely to lead us to the goal state. 
To take such decisions, it uses heuristics (an evaluation function) which indicates 
how close the current state is to the goal state.
